# Ollama Cog Model - qwq:32b

This is an implementation of the Ollama model [qwq:32b](https://ollama.com/library/qwq:32b) as a [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) model.

## Development

Follow the [model pushing guide](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-model) to push your own model to [Replicate](https://replicate.com).
    
## Basic Usage

To run a prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="How many r in strawberry"


## Output

   Let's see... the word is "strawberry." I need to find out how many 'r's are in it. Okay, let's spell it out slowly: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. I can see that there are two 'r's in the word. Wait, let me check again because sometimes letters can be tricky. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, there's an 'r' after the s, then another one between e and y at the end. So that's two 'r's. I think that's correct. But just to be sure, maybe I should look it up or have someone else check it. But I'm pretty confident that there are two 'r's in "strawberry." Maybe I can count the letters one by one: S is 1, T is 2, R is 3, A is 4, W is 5, B is 6, E is 7, R is 8, R is 9, Y is 10. Wait, that says there are three 'r's. But earlier I thought there were only two. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me do it again: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Okay, first 'r' is the third letter, then another one before the last letter, and another one before that. So yes, there are three 'r's. I don't know why I thought there were only two earlier. Maybe I skipped one. So, the correct answer is three 'r's in "strawberry." I should remember that for future reference.
